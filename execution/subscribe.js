 * is not an async iterable.
 *
 * If the client-provided arguments to this function do not result in a
 * compliant subscription, a GraphQL Response (ExecutionResult) with
 * descriptive errors and no data will be returned.
 *
 * If the source stream could not be created due to faulty subscription
 * resolver logic or underlying systems, the promise will resolve to a single
 * ExecutionResult containing `errors` and no `data`.
 *
 * If the operation succeeded, the promise resolves to an AsyncIterator, which
 * yields a stream of ExecutionResults representing the response stream.

 * Accepts either an object with named arguments, or individual arguments.
