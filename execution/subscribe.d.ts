/**
 * Implements the "Subscribe" algorithm described in the GraphQL specification.
 *
 * Returns a Promise which resolves to either an AsyncIterator (if successful)
 * or an ExecutionResult (error). The promise will be rejected if the schema or
 * other arguments to this function are invalid, or if the resolved event stream
 * is not an async iterable.
 *
 * If the client-provided arguments to this function do not result in a
 * compliant subscription, a GraphQL Response (ExecutionResult) with
 * descriptive errors and no data will be returned.
 *
 * If the source stream could not be created due to faulty subscription
 * resolver logic or underlying systems, the promise will resolve to a single
 * ExecutionResult containing `errors` and no `data`.
 *
 * If the operation succeeded, the promise resolves to an AsyncIterator, which
 * yields a stream of ExecutionResults representing the response stream.
 *
 * Accepts either an object with named arguments, or individual arguments.
