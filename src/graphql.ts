/**
 * This is the primary entry point function for fulfilling GraphQL operations
 * by parsing, validating, and executing a GraphQL document along side a
 * GraphQL schema.
 *
 * More sophisticated GraphQL servers, such as those which persist queries,
 * may wish to separate the validation and execution phases to a static time
 * tooling step, and a server runtime step.
 *
 * Accepts either an object with named arguments, or individual arguments:
 *
 * schema:
 *    The GraphQL type system to use when validating and executing a query.
 * source:
 *    A GraphQL language formatted string representing the requested operation.
 * rootValue:
 *    The value provided as the first argument to resolver functions on the top
 *    level type (e.g. the query object type).
 * contextValue:
 *    The context value is provided as an argument to resolver functions after
 *    field arguments. It is used to pass shared information useful at any point
 *    during executing this query, for example the currently logged in user and
 *    connections to databases or other services.
 * variableValues:
 *    A mapping of variable name to runtime value to use for all variables
 *    defined in the requestString.
 * operationName:
 *    The name of the operation to use if requestString contains multiple
 *    possible operations. Can be omitted if requestString contains only
 *    one operation.
 * fieldResolver:
 *    A resolver function to use when one is not provided by the schema.
 *    If not provided, the default field resolver is used (which looks for a
 *    value or method on the source value with the field's name).
 * typeResolver:
 *    A type resolver function to use when none is provided by the schema.
 *    If not provided, the default type resolver is used (which looks for a
 *    `__typename` field or alternatively calls the `isTypeOf` method).
