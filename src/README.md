## graphql-executor

The primary `graphql-executor` module includes everything you need to use a
custom executor with `graphql-js`

```js
import { ... } from 'graphql-executor'; // ES6
var GraphQL = require('graphql-executor'); // CommonJS
```

Each sub directory within is a sub-module of graphql-js:

- [`graphql/execution`](execution/README.md): Custom executor.
